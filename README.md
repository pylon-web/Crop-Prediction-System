# Crop-Prediction-System
Crop Recommendation Based On Local Environmental Parameters Using Machine Learning Approach. Crop recommendation is completely based on environmental factors like soil, weather and rainfall for particular region. So there is need of machine learning techniques like support vector machine and convolutional neural network for classification and clustering dataset. We recommend best suitable crop for particular region based on this regional parametric environmental information. Our contribution solves crop selection problem and ultimately increase the rate of yields and helps to improve economic health of our farmers.
